Is this still possible?</p> <p>Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, it should be rarely necessary to change the general appearance of your site. Most Insiders features enhance the overall experience, e.g. by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback widget. While these features add value for the user of your site, they shouldn't be necessary for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only content-related features in Insiders that can't be properly previewed by non-Insiders users are:</p> <ul> <li>Annotations</li> <li>Card grids</li> </ul> <p>This means that outside collaborators are able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins that are exclusive to Insiders, it's recommended to split configuration into a base <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and one with plugin overrides via configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/#payment","title":"Payment","text":"<p>We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month.

Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license. However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use   it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it,   but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the   sponsorware strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a   collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you   may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like.   Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks.</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies like Python Markdown Extensions enhance existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Note that $15 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com, stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"insiders/getting-started/","title":"Getting started with Insiders","text":"<p>Material for MkDocs Insiders is a compatible drop-in replacement for Material for MkDocs, and can be installed similarly using <code>pip</code>, <code>docker</code> or <code>git</code>.

As the project grew over time, we found that maintaining and managing the overhead that comes with growth became more challenging and time-consuming.</p> <p>In order to sustain the project and add new and useful features more frequently, we decided to create the Insiders edition, with early access to the latest and greatest features of Material for MkDocs. The subscription-based model of the Insiders edition allows us to dedicate more time and resources to the project, which benefits all users of Material for MkDocs. Once our funding goals based on monthly subscriptions are hit, the Insiders features of those^ funding goals are released to the community edition, letting everyone benefit from them.</p> <p>Maintaining both the community and Insiders editions is an ongoing process, and we rely on our sponsors to support us on a monthly basis, which makes this whole project possible.</p> <p>What features are included in the Insiders edition?</p> <p>The Insiders edition includes more than 20 additional features. You can find an overview of these features on our Insiders page, which is updated when new features are added and released.</p> <p>How often is the Insiders edition updated?</p> <p>We try to keep our open issue count low, fixing known bugs quickly. Both our repositories, the community and Insiders edition, are constantly updated with bug fixes and new features.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/faq/sponsoring/#sponsorship","title":"Sponsorship","text":"<p>Can I sponsor the project without a GitHub account?</p> <p>Yes. You can support Material for MkDocs by sponsoring us on Ko-fi, regardless of whether you have a GitHub account or not. However, please note that Insiders is provided as a private repository on GitHub. If after sponsoring, you'd like to gain access to the repository, you'll need to have a GitHub individual or bot account that can be added as a collaborator. If your organization doesn't use GitHub or/and host its repositories on other platforms, you can mirror the Insiders repository in your environment once you have access.</p> <p>Which sponsoring tier should I choose?</p> <p>The sponsoring tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial tiers. If you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or non-commercial Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from, depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using Material for MkDocs, we offer three different commercial tiers, from which you can choose depending on your requirements.</p> <p>Also, please read what is considered commercial use.</p> <p>Why are one-time sponsorships not granted access to Insiders?</p> <p>Primarily due to technical reasons, that we're working on lifting in the future. We use GitHub webhooks to determine our current active sponsors. When you create or cancel your monthly subscription, GitHub sends events that we use to automatically add and remove collaborators.</p> <p>Note that $15 is the minimum amount to be granted access to Insiders.</p> <p>How are sponsorship contributions used?</p> <p>It's vital to recognize that the total sponsorship amount doesn't directly translate into the funds we have available for use. The way we allocate sponsorship amounts is detailed as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Taxes: Since we provide a service to our sponsors, we're of course     legally obligated to pay sales tax. This requirement applies to all     sponsorship contributions, aligning us with standard business practices     as for the rest of the world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sponsorships: A significant portion of our funding is redirected to     upstream projects. This cultivates collaboration and supports the broader     Open Source ecosystem. Those projects and their maintainers are essential     for the ongoing development of Material for MkDocs.</p> <p>Explore our sponsorships.</p> </li> <li> <p>Funds: We are in the process of forming a team devoted to Material for     MkDocs and are proactively compensating critical contributors. These     funds cover various aspects of the project, like the creation of new     features, bug resolution, support, and sponsor relations.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Are there any limitations on the number of sponsors for a particular tier?</p> <p>No, there are no limitations on the number of sponsors for any tier. You can sponsor the project at any tier regardless of how many other sponsors are already there.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/faq/sponsoring/#payment-billing","title":"Payment &amp; billing","text":"<p>Is there a trial period for the Insiders edition?</p> <p>No, we do not offer a trial period for the Insiders edition. However, if you're a company and are considering sponsoring on the commercial tier, but want to first give the Insiders edition a try, you can sponsor on the $15 tier with a personal account for non-commercial evaluation purposes.</p> <p>Additionally, our subscription model allows you to cancel your sponsorship anytime. If you decide to cancel, your sponsorship will remain active until the end of your billing cycle.</p> <p>What payment options do you accept?</p> <p>We manage all our transactions and sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors and Ko-fi. To become a sponsor of Material for MkDocs on GitHub, visit our sponsors' page. On there, you can choose from five different sponsorship tiers and pay by credit card. Please note that as of the beginning of 2023, GitHub no longer supports PayPal payments. If you wish to pay with PayPal, you can find a selection of our sponsorship tiers on Ko-fi. Both platforms provide you with a payment receipt once your purchase is successful.</p> <p>If you're a company and need assistance choosing the right payment method, please don't hesitate to reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Are discounts available for the Insiders edition, such as student discounts?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we are not able to offer any discounts for the Material for MkDocs Insiders program. To ensure that everyone can afford the Insiders program and keep the barrier as low as possible, we have set prices as low as $15 a month for non-commercial use.</p> <p>Do you offer free access to Insiders for Open Source projects?</p> <p>No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders edition. We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. However, it's important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team, investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project. Material for MkDocs and its core features are free to the community through our Open Source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself is already free.</p> <p>However, we do offer an affordable sponsorship tier starting at $15 a month, which is meant for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for MkDocs to build 1-2 sites for non-commercial purposes. This tier provides access to all new features, benefiting you from our ongoing development efforts.</p> <p>Is Insiders free for those who contribute to this project?</p> <p>Great question! We can not offer free access to \"drive-by\" contributors that only fix minor issues like typos or add new languages. These contributions are always welcome, but as we need to review them, they result in a higher time investment from our side and don't compensate for this work. However, as this project keeps growing, we always seek for individuals to support us. In return, we offer financial compensation or/and Insiders access. If you are interested and have experience in the technologies and paradigms listed below, please get in touch with us at sponsors@squidfunk.com:</p> <ul> <li>Deep knowledge of CSS, HTML, TypeScript</li> <li>Experience with progressive enhancement and responsive design</li> <li>Experience with reactive programming with RxJS</li> <li>Solid understanding of Python, MkDocs + ecosystem</li> <li>Solid technical writing skills</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, we're working on a contributor program that will reward contributors that engage in the community by answering questions and helping users with access to Insiders.</p> <p>How can I set my billing to monthly or yearly?</p> <p>You can sponsor Material for MkDocs on a monthly or yearly basis. Depending on your billing cycle you automatically become a monthly or yearly sponsor. Your billing cycle is an account-level setting that you can easily change in your account. If, for some reason, you cannot make this change, you can create a dedicated bot account with a yearly billing cycle on GitHub, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or further questions, please contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Can I get an invoice for my sponsorship payment?</p> <p>Right now, we can't provide you with an invoice for your sponsoring transaction, as GitHub Sponsors handles all transactions for us. However, both payment platforms, GitHub and Ko-Fi, automatically send you a payment receipt via mail once the sponsorship is active.</p> <p>Furthermore, we are working on a solution to optimize access management and more features. If you are interested in this, please get in touch with us via mail at sponsors@squidfunk.com or turn on all notifications for MkDocs, and we will reach out as soon as we are live.</p> <p>Can I switch between different sponsoring tiers?</p> <p>Yes, you can switch between different sponsoring tiers at any time. Simply go to the GitHub Sponsors page and change your sponsoring tier. Once you make that change, you will immediately change to the new tier.</p> <p>If you change to a higher tier, the amount will be prorated according to your billing cycle.</p> <p>Can I sponsor the project for a specific feature or development goal?</p> <p>While sponsoring specific goals directly is not possible, our sponsoring goals are connected to specific features or development goals aligned with the project's roadmap. You can find an overview of these sponsoring goals and their associated features on our website. Insider users have early access to all already developed features, including those associated with higher funding goals that will be reached at a later stage. If you're interested in accessing these features, becoming a sponsor is the way to go. If you have a feature in mind that you would like to see on the list, we encourage you to initiate a new discussion to evaluate it with others.</p> <p>What happens if I reach my sponsoring limit for my current tier?</p> <p>If you extend the number of sites that are in your current sponsoring limit, please upgrade your sponsorship to a higher tier to continue using the Insiders version and build more sites. The change will be effective immediately.</p> <p>Do you offer refunds for sponsoring payments?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer any refund for sponsorship payments. GitHub Sponsors and Ko-Fi manage all sponsoring transactions. Because of that, we do not have any insights into the details of the funds and cannot access them. If you have any payment issues, please get in touch with the GitHub or Ko-Fi support team, as they can help you.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/faq/sponsoring/#access-management","title":"Access management","text":"<p>How do I gain access to the private Insiders repository?</p> <p>If you sponsored with your individual account, you should have received an email invitation to the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository right after you initiated your sponsorship. Simply accept the invitation within seven days to gain access.</p> <p>If you sponsored using an organization account, please note we need an individual account that we can list as a collaborator of the private Insiders repository. After you initiate your sponsorship, please email us at sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of the individual or bot account. Once you provide us with this information, we will add the account as a collaborator, and after you accept the invitation, you will gain access to the repository.</p> <p>If you have yet to receive the email or the invitation link has expired, please contact us, the maintainers, at sponsors@squidfunk.com. We're working on a solution that will allow you to manage collaborator status yourself.</p> <p>Why can't our whole organization get access to Insiders?</p> <p>Currently, it is not possible to grant access to an organizational account, as GitHub only allows for adding individual user accounts. We are working on a solution ourselves to simplify access for organizations. For now, to ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual, we recommend creating a bot account, i.e., a GitHub account that does not belong to a specific individual but is listed as the owner of the organizational account and using this account for sponsorship.</p> <p>Do I need to fork the repository to use it?</p> <p>It depends. If you are using the Insiders edition as an individual, you can work directly with the private repository, as you do not need to share the Insiders features with others. If you are working with a team, it is best to create a private fork using the individual account you listed as a collaborator of Material for MkDocs to grant access to all members of your organization to your fork.</p> <p>Can I share my Insiders access with others?</p> <p>At the moment, it is not possible to directly share your collaborator status for the private Insiders repository with other accounts. However, if you are working with a team and would like them to access Insiders, you can share the Insiders repository by utilizing options such as cloning, forking, or mirroring. By doing so, you can start collaborating with your team members on the new repository you have shared. This way, you can collectively benefit from the Insiders features and work together on the project.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/faq/sponsoring/#runtime-cancellation","title":"Runtime &amp; cancellation","text":"<p>How long is my sponsorship valid?</p> <p>Your sponsorship is valid for as long as your monthly or yearly subscription is valid.

If you sponsored using an organizational account, please ensure that you cancel your sponsorship using the same organizational account rather than your individual account.</p> <p>What happens when I cancel my sponsorship?</p> <p>If you choose to cancel your subscription to Insiders, you will be automatically removed by GitHub as a collaborator on the day your cancellation is effective. From that day on, you will no longer receive future updates. However, you are welcome to continue using the latest version that was available to you at the time of your cancellation for as long as you like.</p> <p>Please note that GitHub deletes private forks, so you may want to take steps to ensure that you have a backup of the software if necessary and use the locally installed version.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/faq/sponsoring/#licensing","title":"Licensing","text":"<p>What constitutes commercial use of the Insiders version?</p> <p>Commercial use refers to any use of the software for a business or for-profit purpose. This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether or not they generate revenue directly from the software. We offer different pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of different businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the software within your organization is also considered commercial use, as with all commercial software.</p> <p>What constitutes non-commercial use of the Insiders version?</p> <p>Non-commercial use of our Material for MkDocs refers to private use. This includes individuals using the Insiders edition for private or purely non-commercial Open Source projects. We offer two different tiers for non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you want to build.</p> <p>What is your fair use policy?</p> <p>Our fair use policy includes the following guidelines:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please refrain from distributing the source code of Insiders. While you may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may privately fork or mirror it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing development and support of the software. If this guidelines is violated, everybody loses, as it will reduce the time of us maintainers we can set aside to push this project forward.</p> </li> <li> <p>As our sponsoring tiers are based on the number of sites you want to build, please make sure to upgrade your sponsorship once your current sponsoring tier limit has been reached.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Does the Insiders version have a different license?</p> <p>No. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license.</p> <p>Can outside collaborators build and run the documentation locally without access to Insiders?</p> <p>Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, changing the general appearance of your site should be optional. Most Insiders features enhance the overall experience, e.g., by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback widget. While these features add value for your site's users, they should be optional for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only content-related feature in Insiders that non-Insiders users can't properly preview are Card grids.</p> <p>This means that outside collaborators can build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs, and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins exclusive to Insiders, it's recommended to split configuration into a base <code>mkdocs.yml</code> and one with plugin overrides via configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/faq/sponsoring/#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>How can I contact support if I have questions about becoming a sponsor? </p> <p>If you have any questions and would like to contact us before starting your sponsorship, we are happy to answer all your non-technical questions about the Insiders program via email at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>All technical questions should be asked openly on our discussion board.</p> <p>Is additional support available for Material for MkDocs Insiders users?</p> <p>Yes, we provide non-technical support related to sponsoring at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

If your purchase departmenz requires additional time and effort from our team, please be aware that the setup fee will apply. For detailed information and specific inquiries, please reach out to us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p> <p>Can I sponsor privately?</p> <p>Yes, you can. GitHub gives you the option to set your sponsorship to private when you set up your sponsorship. Additionally, we have a recommended workflow for you: We suggest you create a new GitHub bot account. This bot account should not be tied to a particular individual and should be privately listed as an owner of your GitHub organization. This account can then be used to sponsor Material for MkDocs privately. As a bot account, it will automatically be listed as a collaborator of the private Insiders repository. You can clone, fork, or mirror using this account. All information will be kept confidential; only the bot account and us maintainers will have insights into his sponsorship.</p> <p>Are there any geographical restrictions on becoming a sponsor?</p> <p>No, there are no geographical restrictions for becoming a sponsor. We welcome sponsorships from individuals and organizations worldwide. As long as your credit card is valid and accepted by GitHub or Ko-Fi, you are eligible to become a sponsor and support the project, regardless of your location.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Priority support means we will prioritize your issue, meaning we will look into it and do our best to solve your issue asap. However, the prioritized bug support does not mean that we can solve your issue before any others since some issues might take more time to solve.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}]}
